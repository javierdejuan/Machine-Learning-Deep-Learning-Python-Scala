## How to build an Equirectangular Grid

The equirectangular grid is used to build panoramic images as theses ones:

WIth the correct viewer, this images can then be shown in a [360](https://veer.tv/photos/improved-street-jazz-concert-180510) degrees environnement:

A detailed explanation of the foundations of the Equirectangular grid can be fond [here](https://artbellinsky.com/curved-drawing-lessons-2-the-spherical-geometry/). In a glimpse, the equirectangular grid is nothing but the register of the lattitude and longitude angles in a cartesian plane where the vertical axis is the latitude and the horizontal axis is the longitude.

The purpose of this exercise is to find a mathematical definition of the equirectangular grid. There are many ways to solve this problem, here we have chosen to introduce some basic ideas in Riemanm's Geometry because of Riemann's contribution to the formalisation of curved spaces. 


## Geodesics in the 2-sphere

As we have seen earlier, an equirectangular grid can be generated by calculating geodesics on a spherical surface.
The differential equation of geodesics can be then obtained in a very intuitive way as explained in the following [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IiF31jS_HuI&t=13s):


This code computes geodesic's differential equation in a 2-sphere. For each iteration of the loop, the initial vector is updgrade.
Parallel transport is then confirmed since the ending vector directions equals the starting direction.
