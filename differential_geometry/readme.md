## How to build an Equirectangular Grid

The equirectangular grid is used to build panoramic images as theses ones:
WIth the correct viewer, this images can then be shown in a [360](https://veer.tv/photos/improved-street-jazz-concert-180510) degrees environnement:

## Geodesics in the 2-sphere

This code computes geodesic's differential equation in a 2-sphere. For each iteration of the loop, the initial vector is updgrade.
Parallel transport is then confirmed since the ending vector directions equals the starting direction.
