Cubemap grid

An easy way to build a panoramic illustration is through a cubemap.

This simplification of the sphere in 6 sides, can give very good results in some cases, where the objects represented are far enough away 
from the center of the cubemap.
It works very well in urban skecthes, for example.

The advantage of this method is that we avoid the distortion of the equirectangular grid when we approach the pole, making very tricky freehand drawings.
In contrast, using the cube map, we only need to make 6 drawings, each one in a very easy central perspective, each drawing covering a 45 degrees Field Of View angle.
Each of this drawings represents the intersection of the world with each side of the cubemap.
In practice, a draughtman needs to rotate 90 degrees in latitude or longitude from his initial point of view, and then draw what he sees in front of him.

Once we have our cubemap, we need to transform it into an Equirectangular format, in order to be represented as a 360ยบ image in the most popular panoramic or virtual reality viwers.

Equirectangular transformation from given cubemap
</p>

The following scripts converts a cubemap to an equirectangular. 
You can find the full script [here](https://github.com/javierdejuan/stuff/blob/master/VirtualReallityFoundamentals/code/HexaedroToEquirectPy.py).

In order to avoid interpolation in the final equirectangular, we have choosen a reverse method to transform the cubemap.
The algorithm iterates through the equirectangular file, then, builds a unitary vector of the given point with its latitude and longitude and 
then finds the intersection of this ray within the cubemap.
Finaly, the scripts copies the pixel found to the its location in the equirectangular file.

The script assumes the input file is called "cubemap.png" and this file must have a 4:3 ratio. It then produces an output file called "equirectangular.png"
